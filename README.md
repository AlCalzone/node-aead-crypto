# node-aead-crypto
OpenSSL bindings for AEAD ciphers

## Supported ciphers
* AES-CCM
* AES-GCM

This package is based on code from https://github.com/spark/node-aes-ccm and https://github.com/xorbit/node-aes-gcm.
I've updated both to compile on Windows machines and included configuration to automatically precompile binaries for multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, OSX, ARM).
